# api-pi

A REST API that implements some common REST endpoints on a Character(GET, POST, DELETE).

## Solution's Architecture

The app's architecture follows the following architecure, ensuring good practices and single responsability principle.

![App's Architecture](architecture_diagram.jpg)

###Â Setup project 

1. Clone/fork repoo

### Using Docker:

2. In the root folder run:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.dev -t api-pi .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd)/app/database:/app/database api-pi
```

3. Once the container is running, to run unit tests:

```bash
docker exec <CONTAINER ID> pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term tests/
```
### Without Docker

2. In the root folder run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
exec uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0
```

3. Once the project is up, to run unit tests:

```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term tests/
```

Once the SQLLite DB is started, a file called database.db will be created inside app/database. That file will persist the data.

The -v $(pwd)/app/database:/app/database tag in Docker version is to set a volume to persist that file data in your local environment.
